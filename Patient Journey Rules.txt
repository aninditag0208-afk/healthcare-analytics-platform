                           Market Area- Oncology

1. Breast HER2+
1a. Patient Funnel

Rule 1 - Breast Cancer Diagnosed Patients: Identifying all Breast cancer patients based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes
Rule 2 - Minimum Two Primary Diagnosis atleast 15 days apart: 2 diagnoses to ensure that we filter out all the mis-diagnosed patients
Rule 3 - Min 1 year look back: At least one year look back period to ensure that we have entire journey of a patient since 1st breast cancer diagnosis
Rule 4 - Quarterly eligibility: Ensuring that we have continuous capture in the data for a robust patient journey
Rule 5 - No treatment before diagnosis: Filtering for patients without any prior treatment to ensure that the patient has data from his first diagnosis
Rule 6 - No metastatic claims before diagnosis: Filtering for patients without any prior secondary diagnosis to ensure that the patient has data from his first diagnosis
Rule 7 - HER2+ Patients: Identifying HER2+ patients based on utilization of backbone drugs for HER2+

Backbone HER2+ drugs - 
Trastuzumab, Perjeta, Kadcyla, Tykerb, Enhertu, Nerlynx, Phesgo, Tukysa, Margenza



1b. Episode & Regimen Creation 
An episode is defined as continuous usage of a drug, where refills occur within the Grace window
Episodes are created only for the lot relevant treatments (or drugs). 
How to create episodes :
	•	Filter for Lot relevant drugs
	•	For every drug claim, check if the gap between the next fill date and the current rx end date (current fill date + Days of supply) < grace, it is said to be a continuation of the current episode. 
	•	If the gap > Grace, then the claim is marked as a new episode. 
Note: Episodes are created for every drug of a patient. 

A regimen is defined as the combination of the treatments undergone by a patient in its journey. They are derived from the episodes 

How to create regimens: 
	•	From the episode table, where in we have episode start date and end date for every drug, we 



1c . Lot Initialization Rules



Treatment A –  Drugs which are only approved for metastatic stage
Navelbine , Megace ,  Ibrance, Gemcitabine, Faslodex,  
Aredia, Novantrone, Enhertu , Tukysa , Margenza 

Treatment B – 
AC (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, TC (taxcane, platin), 
FEC (adrucil, cyclophosphamide, ellence), 
CMF (adrucil, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and chemo regimen are used for early stage breast cancer



1c. LOT Progression Rules

Rule 1: Movement from one HER2+ drug to another could be due to the previous HER2+ drug is not working & the disease might have worsened. Hence, movement to another HER2+ drug is a progression. Herceptin, Perjeta combination is an exception since Perjeta is often taken along with Herceptin

Rule 2: Addition of any lower priority drug group to a regimen involving a higher priority drug is not a line change. The lower priority drug could be added as a supplement to the main/primary therapy. For ex: addition of a Hormone therapy to a Chemo could indicate the physician has prescribed hormone therapy for HR+ patients

Rule 3: 
 For regimens without a HER2+ backbone, the switch to a drug from within Chemotherapy or targeted therapy is a progression if previous regimen length >= 90 days (based on suggestions/feedback from the AZ medical team)
 Movement from AI (Aromatase Inhibitors) to CDK (hormone therapy) and vice versa is a progression. Movement within AI or CDK is a progression if gap between regimens >= 180 days (Hormone therapies are generally taken for lunger durations & also based on suggestions/feedback from the AZ medical team) – (Refer page 60 & 61 of NCCN guidelines (Invasive Breast cancer))

Rule 4: Switch to a HER2+ drug from other groups will be a progression if previous drug usage is for more than 90 days. Else it gets combined (Shifting to a HER2+ targeted therapy from non HER2+ targeted therapy might indicate severeness & diseases progression)

Rule 5: Shifting to a chemo can be indication of severity and hence considered as progression if previous drug usage is for more than 90 days. Else it gets combined
Rule 6: Usage of a targeted therapy is considered a progression if previous drug usage is for more than 90 days

Rule 7: To prevent relapse, patients in stable state might switch to AI mono regimens. Such cases are not progression. (Need to check the % of such cases in the data)

Rule 8: If current & previous regimens are same & have a gap less than 180 days, then it is not a progression
